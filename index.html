    <p>The <em>jellyfish</em> is awesome for many reasons! Many of their species are bioluminescent and make beautiful patterns in the water. Jellyfish have a unique life cycle, earning them the nickname "immortal jellyfish." Jellyfish have been around for over 500 million years, making them the oldest creatures on Earth.
